        Today's web is inefficient and expensive : 
        HTTP downloads files from one server at a time — but peer-to-peer 
        IPFS retrieves pieces from multiple nodes at once, enabling substantial 
        bandwidth savings. With up to 60% savings for video, 
        IPFS makes it possible to efficiently distribute high volumes of data without duplication.

        Today's web can't preserve humanity's history :
        The average lifespan of a web page is 100 days before it's gone forever. 
        The medium of our era shouldn't be this fragile. 
        IPFS makes it simple to set up resilient networks for mirroring data, 
        and thanks to content addressing, files stored using IPFS are automatically versioned.

        Today's web is centralized, limiting opportunity :
        The Internet has turbocharged innovation by being one of the great
        equalizers in human history — but increasing consolidation of control 
        threatens that progress. IPFS stays true to the original vision of an open, 
        flat web by delivering technology to make that vision a reality.

        IPFS powers the creation of diversely resilient networks that 
        enable persistent availability — with or without internet backbone 
        connectivity. This means better connectivity for the developing world, 
        during natural disasters, or just when you're on flaky coffee shop wi-fi.
